                    Hi, I am Ying Yang. In the Astro Digital, my responsibility is dealing with the coding, such as JS and CSS. I am studying level 3 IDP at Fanshawe College. 
                    I have experienced on making videos and wedding design. I am so interested in studing coding and motion design. I also likes watching dramas and cooking. 
                    After I gradute from Fanshawe, I will apply a higher degree that is relative with media. I want to be a motion designer or front-end developer, if I want to find a job in Ontario. And I have a long experience in Marketing so I think I will be grew up in the media field.

                    Hello there! I am a team member of Astro Digital. I am responsible for UX/UI design and front-end parts for our clients. My role is to create responsive wireframes which are suitable for front-end and back parts. After graduating from Fanshawe College I am working for Astro Digital since 2022 as UX/UI junior designer and junior front-end dev.

                    Hello, my name is Matthew Tenuta and I am the Head Graphic Designer at Astro Digital. Our main goal at Astro Digital is to help grow your company into something which reflects your values and you can be proud of. As the Head Graphic Designer, it is my responsibility to visualize and create graphics as well as other media you need. I have experience with front end development as I provided some HTML for our Astro Digital website. 
                    I am currently a second year student in the  Fanshawe College interactive media design program, and after graduating I hope to obtain a job related to graphic design/video editing. I work hard and try my best in any project I work on whether individual or a group project. I had a lot of fun working with my colleagues on this project and I hope to learn and create more in the future.

                <p>
                    Hi Ya'll. I am Immama. As you might have seen from the above heading, I am a designer and a developer too. I specialize in understanding Astro Digital's clients problems, designing a human-centered design for them, prototype it and help in coding it. As a UX designer and Front-End developer, it is my duty to provide our clients the results and solutions they always have wished for. With experise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I strive to give life to design that I have made for our clients at Astro. 
                    Graduating at Fanshawe College with advanced diploma in Interactive Media Development - 3D Visualization, I always wished to work for a company that values people's dreamms, emotions and help them build it(in this case websites, marketing solutions). By working at Astro Digital, I feel good and can also see my own wish come true.
